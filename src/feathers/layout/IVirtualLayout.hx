	A layout algorithm that supports _virtualization_ of items. In other words,

	those outside of the view port bounds are represented with empty space until
	they are scrolled into view. Useful in components like `ListView`,
	`TreeView`, or `GridView` where dozens or hundreds of items are needed, but
	only a small subset of them are visible at any given moment.
