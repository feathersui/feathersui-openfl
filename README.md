# Feathers UI 1.3.0 for OpenFL and Haxe

[Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is an [open source](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-openfl) framework of [graphical user interface (GUI) components](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/ui-components/) for creative, [cross-platform](https://feathersui.com/cross-platform-guis/) frontend projects. It is especially well-suited for games, interactive data visualizations, and other rich, multimedia experiences. With Feathers UI, you can create native apps for a wide range of devices and platforms — including phones, tablets, desktop computers, game consoles… and you can even deploy to web browsers.

Built using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language and [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/), a user-friendly library for rendering, input, networking, and more. Like Feathers UI, both Haxe and OpenFL are open source, and they may be used for free in commercial projects.

## Minimum requirements

- [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) 4.0
- [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) 8.9.7 (OpenFL 9.3 or newer is recommended)

## Get started

For more detailed instructions, see [Learn: Install Feathers UI for Haxe and OpenFL](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/installation/).

### Installation

Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

Open a terminal, and then install Feathers UI using the following command:

```sh
haxelib install feathersui
```

This will also automatically install any additional required dependencies, like [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/), if necessary. If you are installing OpenFL for the first time, you will also need to run the following command:

```sh
haxelib run openfl setup
```

### Choose a development environment

The following tutorials explain how to create a new Feathers UI project:

- [Command line terminal](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/terminal-new-project)
- [HaxeDevelop](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/haxedevelop)
- [Moonshine IDE](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/moonshine-ide)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/visual-studio-code)

The Haxe programming language is supported by [more editors and IDEs](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html), and it may be possible to configure them to use Feathers UI too.
