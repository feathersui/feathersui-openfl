# Feathers UI: Tab Navigator

This example app demonstrates how use the [`TabNavigator`](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/tab-navigator) component from [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/).

## Live demo

A build of the [_tab-navigator_ sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/tab-navigator/) is hosted on the Feathers UI website, and it may be viewed in any modern web browser.

## Run locally

This project includes an [_project.xml_](https://lime.software/docs/project-files/xml-format/) file that configures all options for [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/). This file makes it easy to build from the command line, and many IDEs can parse this file to configure a Haxe project to use OpenFL.

```

In addition to `html5`, other supported targets include `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `android`, and `ios`. See [Lime Command Line Tools: Basic Commands](https://lime.software/docs/command-line-tools/basic-commands/) for complete details about the available commands.
